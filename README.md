# Native Tracking Time Delayed Events

Example on how to support agency 3rd party tracking on advertorials. 

This code is able to drop a view tracker on page load, then additional trackers after 10, 20 and 30 sec on page.

index.htm is a HTML frontend to do it all for you

doubleclick-events.htm is the actual code if you want to copy/paste the values yourself.
